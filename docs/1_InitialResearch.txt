The purpose of this file is to discuss initial research into
how certain decisions were made with 'postcard creator'.

1.0 PHP FRAMEWORK

A model view controller (MVC) framework is a strong way to go because
of the decoupling of functionality that occurs.  Controllers will
do the routing, models will manipulate the database, and the view
will take care of output.

Months of recent experience with CodeIgniter 3.0 indicates this is
a very good MVC.  So based on favorable real world experience,
its a good choice.

2.0 DATABASE REQUIREMENT

The requirements indicate a standalone (serverless) database is
preferred rather than one with a server.  So the choice is
something like Sqlite3 vs. Mysql.

Standalone should be fine.  However, does Sqlite3 work in CodeIgniter?
I googled it and got a positive at the following URL.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37079746/sqlite3-in-codeigniter-3-0-6

So based on this, we are fine with CodeIgniter.
